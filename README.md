👋Hey, I’m Swasthik!
I’m currently a BCA student with a growing passion for front-end development, UI/UX design, and graphic designing. I’ve been learning tools and frameworks like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and playing around with React to build fun and creative projects. I’m also exploring Python to get better at problem-solving and backend basics.

I adore combining technology with design — crafting interfaces not only useful but also awesome to look at and interact with. Whether it's making a fabulous app UI or writing a nice interactive web site, I enjoy the entire experience.

Beyond the screen, I'm a friendly guy who likes running and swimming, always open to a fresh challenge or a new adventure!

Let's catch up, partner up, or just vibe over awesome ideas ♂🌊🏃‍♂️💻
