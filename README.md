ðŸ‘‹Hey, Iâ€™m Swasthik!
Iâ€™m currently a BCA student diving into front-end development, UI/UX design, and graphic designing. I've been exploring React and other front-end frameworks, and Iâ€™m passionate about building creative and fun projects. I'm also learning Python to expand my skills in backend development.

I love blending technology with design to create user-friendly, beautiful interfaces. When Iâ€™m not coding or designing, youâ€™ll find me outside enjoying a good run, swim, or just exploring new adventures.

Letâ€™s connect and build something awesome together!
